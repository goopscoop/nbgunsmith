# Development

This is a static, front end only site using Handlebars templates and jQuery.

To run, simply open index.html on the root directory.

When developing a template, to test changes run `npm run compile` and refresh page. Need to come up with a more efficient way of doing this. Possibly a `npm compile:watch` script.

Before merging into master, make sure to run `npm run compile`.
